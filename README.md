# Predictive-model-of-House-pricing 
The code performs a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling on a housing dataset. It begins by loading and cleaning the data, addressing missing values, and removing duplicates. Descriptive and univariate analyses provide insights into data distribution and relationships, visualized through plots and heatmaps. Bivariate analysis examines the impact of different variables on SalePrice. Statistical tests, like the Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis, evaluate normality and variable effects. Missing values are imputed, categorical variables are encoded, and new features are engineered. Outliers are identified and treated, and multicollinearity is addressed through VIF calculations. The data is split into training and test sets for model building using OLS regression, with assumptions checked for robustness. The model's performance is evaluated, significant features are interpreted, and the importance of predictive modeling for business decision-making is highlighted.
